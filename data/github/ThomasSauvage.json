Could anyone with access commit the necessary token inside [ansible/roles/reverse-proxy/defaults/main/ovh-api-secrets.yml](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-infrastructure/blob/feat-setup-monitoring/ansible/roles/reverse-proxy/defaults/main/ovh-api-secrets.yml)?\r\n\r\nThe procedure is detailed in [docs/nginx-reverse-proxy.md#How-to-add-wildcard-certificates](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-infrastructure/blob/feat-setup-monitoring/docs/nginx-reverse-proxy.md#How-to-add-wildcard-certificates).\r\n\r\nThis token could be just for `openfoodfacts.org`. But I believe it would be useful to have one token that does both `openfoodfacts.org` and `openfoodfacts.net` (and other domains we possess?), if we plan on having a reverse proxy on a host that does both `openfoodfacts.org` and `openfoodfacts.net`."
