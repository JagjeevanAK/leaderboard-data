NO\r\n\r\n:warning: **Currently we don't allow this as a source** :warning: \r\n- because of legal reasons\r\n- we focus on prices in physical shops\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\nIn the [about page](https://prices.openfoodfacts.org/about) & in the [OFF support](https://support.openfoodfacts.org/help/en-gb/29-open-prices/98-do-you-consider-scraping-prices-from-retailers-websites)\r\n> For legal and technical reasons, we don't consider scraping prices from retailers' websites as a valid way to contribute to Open Prices. We want to make sure that the prices we collect are accurate and up-to-date, and receiving scraped prices from contributors doesn't allow us to do that.\r\n> Price scraping is a considered option in a future version of Open Prices, but it would be done by Open Prices itself so that we can have a proof of the price based on the HTML page.\r\n\r\n### Related issues\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/openfoodfacts/open-prices/issues/512",
