    "text": "Hi Open Food Facts community,\n\nI’m Dayyan Chaudhri, and I’ve submitted a proposal for Google Summer of Code 2025 focused on porting and enhancing the Open Prices features in the Open Food Facts mobile app. While the current app supports basic price contributions, my goal is to expand this into a more user-friendly, trustworthy, and impactful feature that benefits shoppers in real time.\n\nKey features I hope to implement include:\n\t•\tPrice contribution improvements (price validation, image uploading, location-based store recommendations)\n\t•\tVisual price graphs and multi-store comparisons\n\t•\tCredibility tools like price flagging, voting, and consistency checks\n\t•\tOffline syncing for smoother contribution workflows\n\nI believe this project can significantly improve accessibility to pricing data, especially in communities where the price of an item can significantly impact a whole family. If you have any feedback or ideas, I would love to hear from you. I am all about making the best contributions I can!\n\nWhile this is what I have proposed, I am more than open to shifting and adapting my approach.\n\nBest,\nDayyan Chaudhri",

Important info should be highlighted at the starting of the section which are useful for normal user.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5464117a-8e0f-4d04-b8c6-688c3f7226fb)\r\n_This page has too much information in small section which will confuse the user and led to less screen time._\r\n\r\n### **3) Enhancing Home Page:**\r\n\r\n- Consider removing the automatic opening of the scanner, which currently occupies half of the screen on the front page. This can make the front page more engaging.\r\n- Instead we can integrate a scanner button within the search bar, allowing users to click and open the scanner only when needed. (Just like google has image search).\r\nSo that in this remaining space we can display previous searches by the user or some top searches.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a3b24af-0d64-4796-bd09-26a15184e631)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  ",

    "text": "Hi, I hope I'm in the right position here for my question concering poor app performance getting data from the server.\r\nI just scanned a code finding a new product and adding it. It worked as expected. After finishing I wanted to scan another code, but getting the data from the server was just impossible. After scanning and seeing the code on the screen, but it stuck loading ending in the message \"information about this product could not be loaded cause of network error\" (freely translated from German).\r\nI had the same problem some weeks ago, there just end using the app in this moment cause indefinitly waiting for an anwer (and not getting one) is just frustrating.\r\nSo what's the problem? Is it a server/API thing? Or network? Or device? Personally I think its more the first or second cause every other app just works as expected while switch and check.\r\nMy version 4.13.1 on Android 12",

    "title": "Programming best practices",
    "text": "After fixing a number of bugs in the Product Opener server code, I have been exposed to much of the Perl code base.  I have enjoyed the opportunity to get to know the team and to write code to contribute to the project.  However, I see a number of issues with the code as it exists now.\r\n\r\nHere is a list of the some the things I have noticed:\r\n- Functions are too large and complex.  Methods are often hundreds of lines of code in length and have large cyclomatic complexity with deeply nested conditional statements.  This makes code difficult to read and understand, increases the risk of bugs, lessens code reuse, limits testing and makes debugging difficult.  A good rule of thumb for method size is 15 lines.\r\n- Object Oriented programming is not used.  Although there is a library of Perl .pm ’modules’ in the ProductOpener namespace, they only contain procedural functions.  There are a great many advantages to OO code, I won’t go into them all here.\r\nA good book to get your feet wet on OO would be: \r\n[Head First Object-Oriented Analysis and Design](https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Object-Oriented-Analysis-Design/dp/0596008678)\r\nThe classic text on OO which is always worth reading is:\r\n[Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612/)\r\n\r\nPerl 5 has had OO support for a while, but it is a fairly weak implementation.  It looks like the [Moose](https://metacpan.org/release/Moose) extension is the current standard for object oriented Perl, see more below.\r\n- HTML  and Javascript are directly generated in Perl code.  This makes maintenance difficult for both server and client code.  There are a number of ways to address this, e.g. templating as in [HTML::Template](https://metacpan.org/pod/HTML::Template)\r\n- As APIs become more popular with patterns like micro services, consider building business logic first as JSON REST services.  This will automatically provide APIs for users and then you can further decouple your front end and business logic by using a pure JavaScript front end like Angular, React, TypeScript to consume those same services.\r\n- Code documentation is lacking, both exportable at the class and method level and inline within the code.  See issue #2203\r\n\r\n- The advantages to implementing the above:\r\n  - Reduced risk of occurrence of new or regression bugs.\r\n  - Easier debugging of problems.\r\n  - Quicker development time\r\n  - Improved testability\r\n  - Code reusability\r\n  - Improved performance\r\n  - Lower cylomatic complexity\r\n\r\nWays to implement these changes:\r\n- Perl code should be written as object oriented with the Moose project.  This will immediately realize all of the advantages listed above.  Moose improves upon standard Perl OO by introducing type checking, custom types, and many other features.  While I have not used Moose myself it looks like it is the latest preferred approach to OO Perl.\r\n- Document code, e.g. with [Perl POD](https://perldoc.perl.org/perlpod.html) as you go along while coding. Perl POD can be automatically converted to HTML and put online.\r\n- Write tests for all code.  The test coverage in OFF is decent ( better than many projects I have worked on) but it should be a priority.\r\n- Consider a new architecture: micro-service with pure JS front ends, etc.\r\n- Consider a more modern language.  Java, Node, Python etc. would be options if we started this project today.\r\n\r\nI understand the OFF is a large legacy project that was started long ago when many of these technologies did not exist and Perl was the best choice for web applications.  With the upcoming development of the self-service platform by Stephane, now might be a good time to consider implementing some of these ideas to secure a healthy future for OFF.",

An additional \"lockable\" parameter would be EAN as opposed to category - ideally jumping straight the the EAN input box to paste the relevant EAN.\r\nAfter checking what the receipt mode UI looks like it would be a variant of it, if it's deemed worth exploring I'll expand in a specific issue and share screenshot of my vision of the UI, based on the current receipt mode.\r\nNow the question is how many user engage ( percentage of prices coming from this opposed to receipt ) in this, how much time do we save ( here's I'm thinking a stopwatch feature could be useful although it might scare away user when they realize how much time they spend for so few prices - so maybe make it bonus interface ) and is it worth the time coding this specific interface.\r\n\r\n### Related issues\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/openfoodfacts/open-prices-frontend/issues/961\r\n- https://github.com/openfoodfacts/open-prices-frontend/issues/983\r\n- https://github.com/openfoodfacts/open-prices/issues/387#issuecomment-2386059566\r\n- https://github.com/openfoodfacts/open-prices/discussions/523",

    "text": "## **Consistent User Management UI Across Open Food Facts Tools**\r\n\r\nGoal: provide a consistent user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) for getting a “Road to KeyCloak” and managing App-specific user settings across various Open Food Facts platforms (Website with Foundation, Flutter App, React Tools like Hunger Games, Open Prices, openfoodfacts-explorer), like favorite stores, currency, dev mode settings for off-explorer…\r\n\r\nIt should try to leverage our Web Component strategy and assumes Keycloak is the central Identity Provider.\r\n\r\n**Core Principles:**\r\n\r\n1. **Centralized Identity & Core Data:** Keycloak is the source of truth for authentication, authorization, and core identity attributes (email, password management, sessions).  \r\n2. **Centralized Extended Profile & Settings API:** A dedicated Open Food Facts backend API service manages user profile data *beyond* core identity (e.g., contribution stats, general preferences) and *tool-specific* settings (e.g., Open Prices currency, favorite stores). This API interacts with Keycloak and Specific tools or backends where necessary.  \r\n3. **Web Component Library for Web UIs:** A library of customizable Lit Web Components provides the standard UI elements for user management on all web platforms (eg Account switcher, access to the page or modal containing app specific settings).  \r\n4. **Shared Design System:** A well-defined design system dictates the visual appearance and interaction patterns, ensuring consistency even for native implementations (Flutter).  \r\n5. **Consistent Customization:** Tool-specific settings are managed by the tools themselves but integrated visually within the structure provided by the core components.\r\n\r\n**Implementation Details:**\r\n\r\n1. **Backend User Profile API:**  \r\n   * **Responsibilities:** CRUD operations for extended OFF profile data and tool-specific settings (stored appropriately, perhaps namespaced by tool). Potentially provides a endpoint for fetching combined user data (core from Keycloak \\+ extended from the tool). Consistency across tools.  \r\n2. **openfoodfacts-webcomponents** (Lit Library):  \r\n   * **Components:** Create components like:  \r\n     * \\<off-profile-switcher\\>: Shows user icon/switcher/logout for navigation bar. Inputs: link to keycloak, link to local settings, user id (to get user photo and user name)  \r\n     * \\<off-settings-layout\\>: A container component providing consistent structure/navigation for settings pages.  \r\n     * *(Other components ? Avoid stepping on KeyCloak)*  \r\n   * **Customization via Slots:** The key to tool-specific settings.  \r\n     * Example: \\<off-settings-layout\\> could have a designated \\<slot name=\"tool-specific\"\\>\\</slot\\>.  \r\n     * Open Prices (whether built in React or using Lit itself) would then render its own settings component (e.g., \\<openprices-preferences\\>) inside that slot:  \r\n       \\<off-settings-layout\\>  \r\n         \\<off-profile-form slot=\"general\"\\>\\</off-profile-form\\>  \r\n         \\<off-account-security slot=\"security\"\\>\\</off-account-security\\>  \r\n         \\<openprices-preferences slot=\"tool-specific\"\\>\\</openprices-preferences\\>  \r\n       \\</off-settings-layout\\>\r\n\r\n     * The openprices-preferences component is responsible for its own UI *and* for interacting with the Backend User Profile API to save its specific settings (currency, stores).  \r\n3. **Platform Integration:**  \r\n   * **Web Tools:** Web component  \r\n   * **Flutter App:**  \r\n     * **Native Implementation:** Build the non keycloak user management screens *natively* in Flutter. **Crucially**, this native UI must strictly adhere to the **Shared Design System**. It interacts directly with the **Backend User Profile API**. Tool-specific settings needed in the app are also built natively.  \r\n     * **Question of the keycloak part, the webview solution is kind of disappointing**  \r\n4. **Shared Design System**",

We have enough interesting issues for everyone.\r\n- I’d rather have someone take on a more significant issue, and be able to deal with ambiguity, and document/mockup/discuss their way out of ambiguity rather than creating issues with limited or no tangible impact.\r\n- You can go through the backlog, and find issues that are additive in terms of User Experience, and are well documented. If they are not, a good thing is to propose analysis, mockups and solutions. It’s as valuable as rushing to code something. We will evaluate of many criteria, code is only one of them.\r\n- You can of course ask precise questions with enough context. “Please guide me” is too wide a question. We want to see your autonomy. “This is the API that seems the right one. Can you confirm it ?” or “Where’s the API to display XYZ ?” are valid questions\r\n- Issue assignment is not a land grab, only one assignment at any given time. We value mergeability, craftsmanship, rather than having issues “vampirised” and having to un-assign weeks later.

Few and simple rules have a better chance to be followed.\r\nWe could prioritise as W3C use to, with keywords “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL”.\r\n\r\n1. Disable password authentication in favour of SSH keys\r\nUsing SSH key IS really simpler, I can write a quick documentation for beginners.\r\n\r\n2. Disable root login over SSH\r\n\r\n3. Working with root or not\r\n\r\n4. Taking care of production resources: always using \"nice\" for scripts manually launched\r\nStéphane's tip: just use `nice ./mycommand -arg1 foo -arg2 bar` (`nice` default to lower the priority).\r\n\r\n5. When possible, use techs that the majority of people knows\r\nOur infrastructure is not so big. Low techs ensure it will be maintainable.\r\nExample: good old scripts vs Ansible.\r\n\r\n6. Standardize some core tools\r\nExample: our standard distro is Linux Debian (well suited with point 5).\r\n\r\n6. Basic tools to install on each machine\r\nExample: htop, goaccess...\r\n\r\n7. Log every sys action on /root/changelog.log\r\n\r\n8. Add important commands beeing played to /root/changelog.log\r\nSo everybody knows what you have done concretly.\r\n\r\n9. Backups?\r\n\r\n10.

And there is a separate section on the Storybook official website showcasing StoryBook from all popular companies: https://storybook.js.org/showcase \r\n\r\nThis tool aligns perfectly with our goals of efficiency and clarity across multiple projects. I believe integrating Storybook will enhance our workflow and make component reuse more seamless.\r\n\r\nLet me know your thoughts!\r\n\r\ncc: @Kout95 , @alexgarel , @teolemon \r\n\r\nExample StoryBook:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1346\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-04-10 at 7 55 06 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07d0e36b-2044-47d0-8a3d-574ac7fd460c\" />",

Users could also want to export their own private data.\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\nI think we should start by public exports, which are the most common need. \r\n\r\nAs a start, we could export the data into CSV, which remains the easiest way to import data into many tools such as LibreOffice, Excel, etc. We should also provide the data model, to let people reuse the data into common data tools or databases. We should also provide a script allowing to import these data into a dev environment.\r\nWe could also provide a PostgreSQL dump to ease the import into the dev environment (but this one should not contain private data).\r\n\r\nOn a second step, which is not very urgent, we could:\r\n* either export the data into other formats, such as Parquet or JSONL\r\n* either provide scripts allowing to generate this formats locally\r\n\r\n",

    "text": "## Use cases\r\n\r\n### Properties related to revisions\r\nSometimes we need to tag some versions of a product. For example, we would like to express that there is [a data issue on the revision 310 of a product](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/product/3017620422003/nutella-ferrero?rev=310), and this issue is now fixed.\r\n\r\n### Reusing a group of property with different values\r\nSometimes we need to give context to some properties. For example we could want to monitor recalled products. But a product can be recalled more than one time. Having [`recalled_product=yes`](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/property/recalled_product) does not have much context: is it finished? when? For a given recall, we would like to know many more information related to this particular recall.\r\n\r\n## Suggestion 1\r\nWe can multiply the properties like this:\r\n* `data_issue_rev_310=Wrong serving size`\r\n* `data_issue_rev_310=Fixed`\r\n* `data_issue_rev_421=Non existing country`\r\n* `product_recall_date_1=2020-06-01`\r\n* `product_recall_country_1=France`\r\n* `product_recall_date_2=2023-12-01`\r\n* `product_recall_country_2=Italy`\r\n\r\n## Suggestion 2\r\nWe can store the revision in the database.\r\n`3749372783457:310` => `data_issue=Wrong serving size`\r\n\r\nBut we need to modify both the database and the interfaces. And this solution does not solve the problem when properties are reused.\r\n\r\n## Suggestion 3\r\nWe can use the namespaces:\r\n* `data_issue:rev_310=Wrong serving size`\r\n* `data_issue:rev_310=Fixed`\r\n* `product_recall:date:1=2020-06-01`\r\n* `product_recall:country:1=France`\r\n* `product_recall:date:2=2023-12-01`\r\n* `product_recall:country:2=Italy`\r\n\r\nWe can even use the namespace to tag more things on a specific revision. Eg.\r\n* `data_issue:rev_310:1=Wrong serving size`\r\n* `data_issue:rev_310:2=Non existing countries`\r\n* `data_issue:rev_310:1=Fixed`\r\n\r\nWith suggestion 3, we would only need to modify interfaces: we should be able to list all the data_issues, and not just the ones corresponding to `data_issue:rev_310`.\r\n",
