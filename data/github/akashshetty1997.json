I'd be happy to help with that.\nI understand that fixing this would require changing how <searchalicious-results> builds templates (avoiding the use of new Function() at runtime) to make it CSP-compatible."

      "text": "> [@akashshetty1997](https://github.com/akashshetty1997) is CSP triggered even when adding the web-components repo as a dependency and using it locally?\n\nYes, CSP still blocks it even when installed locally.\nIt's because <searchalicious-results> uses new Function() at runtime, and CSP blocks dynamic code evaluation by default."
