      "text": "Hello! \n\nI was curious about this bug so I started looking around the code base and the problem seems to be that this edge case doesn't seem to be supported in the code [Ingredients.pm](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-server/blob/main/lib/ProductOpener/Ingredients.pm).\n\nWould adding an `else if` statement at line ~1200 in `parse_specific_ingredients_from_text` to include this edge case be a good way to fix it? This is a really big code file and I want to be certain that my plan is good before I proceed! ðŸ˜„ "
