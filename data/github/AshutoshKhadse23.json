Could you please attach a screenshot?\r\n> \r\n> Instead of repeating values I would have created two finals, but that's another story:\r\n> \r\n> ```dart\r\n> final Color background = lightTheme ? colors.primaryBlack : colors.primaryLight;\r\n> final Color foreground = lightTheme ? Colors.white : colors.primaryDark;\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nBut the color combination of each foreground and background is different somewhere, like:\r\n```\r\nbackgroundColor:\r\n             lightTheme ? colors.primaryBlack : colors.primaryLight,\r\nforegroundColor:\r\n             lightTheme ? Colors.white : colors.primaryDark,\r\n```\r\nAND\r\n```\r\nbackgroundColor:\r\n             lightTheme ? colors.primaryLight : colors.primaryDark,\r\nforegroundColor:\r\n             lightTheme ? colors.primaryDark : colors.primaryLight,\r\n```"
